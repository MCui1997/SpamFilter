# model_trainer.py - Model Training and Evaluation

"""
Machine learning module for spam filter training and classification.

This module implements the core Naive Bayes spam detection algorithm using TF-IDF
feature extraction. It handles model training, evaluation, and real-time message
classification. The module also extracts dynamically learned spam keywords to
demonstrate the model's automatic pattern discovery capabilities, fulfilling
the assignment requirement for non-hardcoded spam detection.
